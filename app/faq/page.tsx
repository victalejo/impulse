    {
      question: "What are the payment options?",
      answer: "We accept Zelle, Cash App, Venmo or Cash.for stripe"
    },
    {
      question: "What is a Foam Party?",
      answer: "It's whatever you want it to be! It can be as simple as filling an area with foam and letting kids jump around and play in it or as involved as creating a dance club vibe with lights, music, and, of course, foam! All you need is foam and people looking to have fun!"
    },
    {
      question: "Is the Foam Slippery?",
      answer: "Foam is about as slippery as water, so it's possible to slip if you're on long grass or a smooth, glossy surface such as tile. To prevent slipping, some guests like to wear water shoes. We also recommend guests avoid running in foamy areas."
    },
    {
      question: "Is your Foam safe?",
      answer: "Yes! Our standard foam solution is biodegradable, non-toxic, non-staining, and hypoallergenic. It is entirely safe for kids, adults, pets (yes, dogs love foam, too!), and even plants! While kids will be OK playing in the bubbles, we have found that some of them like to wear goggles."
    },
    {
      question: "What do you need from me?",
      answer: "We require a $100 deposit to secure the time frame and book your event. Once the event is booked and we show up on site, we will need power (2 outlets), water (1 hose bib per cannon), an area free of clutter to get setup (We don't want people tripping on stuff in the foam!), and people (or animals) ready to have fun!"
    },
    {
      question: "How hard is it to clean up?",
      answer: "It's really NOT! While our foam solution and water will evaporate on its own, we do like to hose down the area before we leave."
    },
    {
      question: "How long does the Foam last?",
      answer: "When left alone, foam can last several hours. However, once guests interact with it, the bubbles start to pop and break up. The more people play in the foam, the quicker it will dissolve. Don't worry though, we are there to replace it as needed!"
    },
    {
      question: "How much space does a FOAM PARTY require?",
      answer: "That is really up to you. We require an area of about 6 x 6 to setup the foam cannon. While we generally suggest about a 20 foot x 20 foot area, we can make the 'foam pit' as large or small as you would like!"
